## What's this project is about
This project for the hackathon is a machine learning-powered credit prediction system. It leverages a dataset of individual's life parameters, such as income, employment history, and credit history, to train a predictive model. This model can then be used by banks to assess the probability of granting credit to individuals. By automating this process, our system aims to streamline and improve the accuracy of credit decision-making for banks.
